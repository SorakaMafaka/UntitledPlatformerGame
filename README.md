# UntitledPlatformerGame
This project is unfinished.  
The goal of the game is to collect all the stars from the level and get to the end of the level.  
Watch out for hedgehogs and falling off the map!  



To run the game through eclipse, you will require Java 8.  
In eclipse, go to File>Import and choose Gradle>Existing Gradle Project.  
After the project gets imported, right click “Untitled Platformer Game” and close it.  
After that, go to untitled-platformer-game-desktop>DesktopLauncher.java – Right click it and press Run As> Java Application
If the program doesn’t run, go to the top of the page, press the down facing arrow next to a white arrow in a green circle, Run configurations.., in there choose Arguments and at the bottom of that window in Working directory: press the option “Other” and choose “File System…” and point the program to the direction of your asset folder (by default YourDiskPath\Graded Unit 2\Maps).  
After that press Run and play the game!
